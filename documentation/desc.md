This JavaScript library has three main purposes when assuming that the principal of supperposition can be used:

1. Doing real time simulation (in othe order of the millisecond)  even for complex modeling
2. Doing parameters inversion using an algorithm such as the Monte Carlo, the Bee, the Ant, a Bayessian approach...
3. Doing sensitivity analysis
